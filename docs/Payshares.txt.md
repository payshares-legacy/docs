Payshares.txt
===========
## Introduction

The Payshares.txt file is used to provide the internet information about your domainâ€™s Payshares integration. Any web site can publish Payshares network information. This is useful to announce your validation key, your federation server, peers you are running, other validators in your UNL, if you are a gateway etc.

### Publishing payshares.txt

Given the domain "DOMAIN", the payshares.txt will be searched for in this order:

- https:/<span></span>/payshares.DOMAIN/payshares.txt
- https:/<span></span>/DOMAIN/payshares.txt
- https:/<span></span>/www.DOMAIN/payshares.txt

### Enabling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
You must enable CORS on the payshares.txt so people can access this file from other sites, the following HTTP header MUST be set for all requests to payshares.txt and its dependent files.

 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

**Important:** You should only enable CORS for payshares.txt (or any files it references), so for example in Apache you would set something like:

```xml
<Location "/payshares.txt">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</Location>
```

Or in nginx:

```json
location /payshares.txt {
 add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
}
```

For other webservers, see: http://enable-cors.org/server.html

### Testing CORS

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to this (replace payshares.payshares.co with where your payshares.txt file is hosted):

  ```bash
  curl --head https://payshares.payshares.co/payshares.txt
  ```

2. Verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present as shown below.

  ```bash
  curl --head https://payshares.payshares.co/payshares.txt
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Content-length: 482
  ...
  ```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` the header is missing.
