## Introduction
Gateways are an integral part of the Payshares ecosystem. They accept currency deposits from their customers and issue credits for that currency on the Payshares network. These credits can be transferred or exchanged within Payshares, and redeemed through the Gateway.

*Throughout the integration guide we will refer to a “currency” as the primary asset a Gateway will hold and issue credit for on the Payshares network. However, a Gateway can hold any asset and issue a corresponding credit on the network. A credit is just a one to one mapping between some unit of asset the gateway holds and the unit of credit on the network.*

## What is a Credit?
There are two types of assets on Payshares: paysharess (the native currency) and credits. Paysharess are native, digital assets in themselves, whereas credits represent an external asset (currency) outside of the payshares network. Gateways are issuers of credits; anyone holding a particular credit issued by the Gateway can redeem the credit for the external asset by giving the credit back to the Gateway. In this regard, credits on Payshares are simply a “currency/issuer pair”. They are only worth what the issuer (Gateway) will redeem them for, and credits can be transferred or exchanged on the Payshares network between accounts that accept (trust) the issuing address of the credit. 

#### Poker Chip Analogy
As an analogy, credits can be thought of as poker chips, and the casino which issued these poker chips is the issuer (Gateway). A customer gives the casino a currency that it supports (customer’s fiat money -> Gateway), and in return the casino gives the customer that many poker chips (Gateway Payshares account -> customer’s Payshares account). These poker chips are marked with 1) the currency (and amount of the currency) they represent and 2) the casino’s name which issued the chips. In Payshares, credits are the same. Credits are a currency/issuer pair with an associated amount, represented in the protocol as an amount object. In Payshares, the issuer (casino name) is a Payshares address controlled by the Gateway. The customer holding poker chips can go back to the casino which issued them at anytime to redeem them for cash.
